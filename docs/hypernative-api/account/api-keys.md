# API Keys

This is the preferred way to control your active API keys and their expiration dates.

Navigate to ⚙️Settings > **API Keys** to add, change, and remove API Keys.

On every API call, simply set the `x-client-id` and `x-client-secret` headers to the **Client ID** and the **Client Secret** provided on the Hypernative platform.&#x20;
